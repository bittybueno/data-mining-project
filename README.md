# Denver Crime Analysis Using Data Mining Techniques

### Marissa Bueno, Chad Brokaw, Daniel Scott -- CSCI4502

## Project Summary
We used Denverâ€™s criminal data along with modern data mining techniques to analyze and determine 
meaningful trends in criminal behavior throughout the city. We used Apriori to produce frequent 
patterns so that we could identify temporal and geographic hotspots. Then we used Naive Bayesian 
Classifier to create models so that we could predict what crime is likely to occur within the city.

## Data
This dataset includes criminal offenses in the City and County of Denver for the previous five calendar 
years plus the current year to date. The data is based on the National Incident Based Reporting System 
(NIBRS) which includes all victims of person crimes and all crimes within an incident.
